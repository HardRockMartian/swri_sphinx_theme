Code
====
The Sphinx Bootstrap Theme uses Bootstrap styling for ``inline code text`` and
::

    multiline
    code text

It also works with existing Sphinx highlighting:

.. code-block:: html

    <html>
      <body>Hello World</body>
    </html>

.. code-block:: python

    def hello():
        """Greet."""
        return "Hello World"

.. code-block:: javascript

    /**
     * Greet.
     **/
    function hello(): {
      return "Hello World";
    }


Footnotes
=========
I have footnoted a first item [#f3]_ and second item [#f4]_.

.. rubric:: Footnotes
.. [#f3] My first footnote.
.. [#f4] My second footnote.

.. [1] A footnote contains body elements, consistently indented by at
   least 3 spaces.

   This is the footnote's second paragraph.

.. [#label] Footnotes may be numbered, either manually (as in [1]_) or
   automatically using a "#"-prefixed label.  This footnote has a
   label so it can be referred to from multiple places, both as a
   footnote reference ([#label]_).

.. [#] This footnote is numbered automatically and anonymously using a
   label of "#" only.

.. [*] Footnotes may also use symbols, specified with a "*" label.
   Here's a reference to the next footnote: [*]_.

.. [*] This footnote shows the next symbol in the sequence.


Citation
========

Citation references, like [CIT2002]_.
Note that citations may get
rearranged, e.g., to the bottom of
the "page".

Citation labels contain alphanumerics,
underlines, hyphens and fullstops.
Case is not significant.

Given a citation like [this]_, one
can also refer to it like this_.


.. [CIT2002] A citation
   (as often used in journals).
.. [this] here.

Comments
========

An "empty comment" does not
consume following blocks.
(An empty comment is ".." with
blank lines before and after.)
..

        So this block is not "lost",
        despite its indentation.

That's it, the text just above this line.

Transitions

Here's a transition:

---------

It divides the section.

Body Elements
=============

Paragraphs
----------

A paragraph.

Bullet Lists
------------

- A bullet list

  + Nested bullet list.
  + Nested item 2.

- Item 2.

  Paragraph 2 of item 2.

  * Nested bullet list.
  * Nested item 2.

    - Third level.
    - Item 2.

  * Nested item 3.

Definition Lists
----------------

Term
    Definition
Term : classifier
    Definition paragraph 1.

    Definition paragraph 2.
Term
    Definition

Field Lists
-----------

:what: Field lists map field names to field bodies, like database
       records.  They are often part of an extension syntax.  They are
       an unambiguous variant of RFC 2822 fields.

:how arg1 arg2:

    The field marker is a colon, the field name, and a colon.

    The field body may contain one or more body elements, indented
    relative to the field marker.

Option Lists
------------

For listing command-line options:

-a            command-line option "a"
-b file       options can have arguments
              and long descriptions
--long        options can be long also
--input=file  long options can also have
              arguments

--very-long-option
              The description can also start on the next line.

              The description may contain multiple body elements,
              regardless of where it starts.

-x, -y, -z    Multiple options are an "option group".
-v, --verbose  Commonly-seen: short & long options.
-1 file, --one=file, --two file
              Multiple options with arguments.
/V            DOS/VMS-style options too

There must be at least two spaces between the option and the
description.

Literal Blocks
--------------

Literal blocks are indicated with a double-colon ("::") at the end of
the preceding paragraph (over there ``-->``).  They can be indented::

    if literal_block:
        text = 'is left as-is'
        spaces_and_linebreaks = 'are preserved'
        markup_processing = None

Or they can be quoted without indentation::

>> Great idea!
>
> Why didn't I think of that?

Line Blocks
-----------

| This is a line block.  It ends with a blank line.
|     Each new line begins with a vertical bar ("|").
|     Line breaks and initial indents are preserved.
| Continuation lines are wrapped portions of long lines;
  they begin with a space in place of the vertical bar.
|     The left edge of a continuation line need not be aligned with
  the left edge of the text above it.

| This is a second line block.
|
| Blank lines are permitted internally, but they must begin with a "|".

    | A one, two, a one two three four

    | Half a bee, philosophically,
    |     must, *ipso facto*, half not be.
    | But half the bee has got to be,
    |     *vis a vis* its entity.  D'you see?
    |
    | But can a bee be said to be
    |     or not to be an entire bee,
    |         when half the bee is not a bee,
    |             due to some ancient injury?

    | Singing...

Block Quotes
------------

Block quotes consist of indented body elements:

    My theory by A. Elk.  Brackets Miss, brackets.  This theory goes
    as follows and begins now.  All brontosauruses are thin at one
    end, much much thicker in the middle and then thin again at the
    far end.  That is my theory, it is mine, and belongs to me and I
    own it, and what it is too.

    -- Anne Elk (Miss)

Doctest Blocks
--------------

Python-specific usage examples; begun with ">>>"
>>> print '(cut and pasted from interactive Python sessions)'

Directives
----------

.. contents:: :local:

These are just a sample of the many reStructuredText Directives.  For
others, please see
http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html.

Topics, Sidebars, and Rubrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. sidebar:: Sidebar Title
   :subtitle: Optional Subtitle

   This is a sidebar.  It is for text outside the flow of the main
   text.  

   .. rubric:: This is a rubric inside a sidebar

   Sidebars often appears beside the main text with a border and
   background color.

.. topic:: Topic Title

   This is a topic.

.. rubric:: This is a rubric

Compound Paragraph
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. compound::

   This paragraph contains a literal block::

       Connecting... OK
       Transmitting data... OK
       Disconnecting... OK
      
   and thus consists of a simple paragraph, a literal block, and
   another simple paragraph.  Nonetheless it is semantically *one*
   paragraph.

This construct is called a *compound paragraph* and can be produced
with the "compound" directive.

Comments
--------

Here's one:

.. Comments begin with two dots and a space. Anything may
   follow, except for the syntax of footnotes, hyperlink
   targets, directives, or substitution definitions.

   Double-dashes -- "--" -- must be escaped somehow in HTML output.

(View the HTML source to see the comment.)
